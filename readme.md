# K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm

K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm (also known as "KNN") is an algorithm and/or method that enable computer to perform classification on a given dataset. The classification is performed by calculating the similarity of the data, using Euclidean Distance.

## Tools Used

Dataset (for training and testing, *csv formatted), Python 3, Numpy.


## Things that I learn from this project
From this simple project or exercise, I was able to deepen my understanding on using Numpy library on Python 3, such as slicing, finding frequent data, calculating euclidean distance, sorting an array using bin.count() and argmax(). Even if this project wasn't beautifully written, and seems too simple for others, yet I'm still proud of my programming progress.
